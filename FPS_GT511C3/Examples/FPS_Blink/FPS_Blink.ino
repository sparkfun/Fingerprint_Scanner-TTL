	TLDR; Wil Wheaton's Law

	This simple sketch turns the LED on and off similar to the Arduino blink sketch.
	It is used to show that communications are working.

// Hardware setup - FPS connected to:
//	  digital pin 4(arduino rx, fps tx)
//	  digital pin 5(arduino tx - 560ohm resistor fps tx - 1000ohm resistor - ground)
//		this brings the 5v tx line down to about 3.2v so we dont fry our fps

void setup()
{
	Serial.begin(9600);
	fps.UseSerialDebug = true; // so you can see the messages in the serial debug screen
	fps.Open();
}


void loop()
{
	// FPS Blink LED Test
	fps.SetLED(true); // turn on the LED inside the fps
	delay(1000);
	fps.SetLED(false);// turn off the LED inside the fps
	delay(1000);
