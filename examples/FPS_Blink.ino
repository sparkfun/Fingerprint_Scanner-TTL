	TLDR; Wil Wheaton's Law

	This simple sketch turns the LED on and off similar to the Arduino blink sketch.
	It is used to show that communications are working.

// Hardware setup - FPS connected to:
//	  digital pin 4(arduino rx, fps tx)
//	  digital pin 5(arduino tx - 560ohm resistor fps tx - 1000ohm resistor - ground)
//		this brings the 5v tx line down to about 3.2v so we dont fry our fps
